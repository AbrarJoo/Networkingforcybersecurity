🌐 Networking for Cybersecurity

> A traffic-first, security-focused repository for mastering core networking concepts through real packet analysis.



This repository contains my coursework, hands-on exercises, notes, and tools used while learning networking specifically for cybersecurity — with a strong emphasis on how network traffic moves, looks, and behaves on the wire.

🚫 This is not CCNA
✅ This is foundational networking for security analysis and pentesting


---

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to build a strong, practical networking foundation required for:

Network traffic analysis

Security monitoring

Intrusion detection

Penetration testing fundamentals


The focus is on protocol behavior, packet flow, and traffic patterns, not application-level details.


---

📚 Learning Path Followed

This repository follows a theory + packet-level practice approach.


---

🧠 Theory Foundation

🎥 Primary Theory Resource

Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking
📺 YouTube Course (12+ hours):
👉 https://youtu.be/PhjHXeMNpp8

This course is used strictly for networking theory, including:

OSI vs TCP/IP (high-level, security perspective)

IP addressing and ports

TCP vs UDP

DNS fundamentals

How data moves across networks

End-to-end packet flow across the internet


⚠️ Intentionally skipped:

Cable types

Enterprise hardware

Deep subnetting drills

🔬 Practical Networking & Packet Analysis

📘 Primary Practice Resource

Practical Packet Analysis — Chris Sanders

This book is the backbone of the hands-on portion, focused on learning how to:

Capture and analyze real network traffic

Understand packet structure and protocol behavior

Follow conversations and flows

Identify normal vs abnormal traffic patterns



---

🧪 Tools Used

Wireshark — Primary packet capture and analysis tool

Cisco Packet Tracer — Visualizing network topology and traffic flow



---

📅 Roadmap Overview

🟢 Phase 1 — Networking Foundations

OSI vs TCP/IP (conceptual)

IP addresses and ports

TCP vs UDP behavior

DNS resolution basics

How packets travel across networks



---

🔵 Phase 2 — Packet Analysis with Wireshark

Capturing real network traffic

Analyzing:

TCP handshakes and flags

DNS queries and responses

Session establishment and teardown


Understanding headers and metadata

Following streams and conversations


❌ Memorizing every field
✅ Understanding why traffic behaves the way it does


---

🟣 Phase 3 — Packet Tracer (Concept Reinforcement)

Packet Tracer is used only for simple exercises, to visually reinforce:

Basic LAN setups

Routers and switching behavior

NAT placement

How traffic flows between devices and networks


> Packet Tracer exists here to answer one question:
“Where is this traffic coming from, and where is it going?”




---

📂 What This Repository Contains

📄 Networking theory notes

🧪 Wireshark packet analysis labs

🌐 Packet Tracer mini-exercises

📊 Observations on traffic behavior and flows



---

🧠 Philosophy Behind This Repo

Most networking resources:

Are exam-oriented

Overemphasize hardware

Delay real traffic exposure


This repository is:

Traffic-first

Protocol-focused

Built for security learners

Centered on understanding, not memorization



---

🚀 Why This Matters for Cybersecurity

Strong networking fundamentals are essential for:

Detecting malicious traffic

Understanding attack paths

Analyzing packet captures during incidents

Building intuition for how attacks move through networks


This repository lays that foundation.
