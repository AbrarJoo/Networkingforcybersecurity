# 🌐 Networking for Cybersecurity

> A **traffic-first, security-focused** repository for mastering core networking concepts through **real packet analysis**.

This repository contains my coursework, hands-on labs, notes, and observations while learning **networking specifically for cybersecurity**, with a strong emphasis on **how network traffic moves, looks, and behaves on the wire**.

🚫 **Not CCNA**
🚫 **Not network engineering**
✅ **Foundational networking for security analysis, detection, and pentesting**

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to build a **practical networking foundation** required for:

* Network traffic analysis
* Security monitoring & SOC work
* Intrusion detection & investigation
* Penetration testing fundamentals

The focus is on:

* **Protocol behavior**
* **Packet flow**
* **Traffic patterns**

—not hardware, certifications, or application development.

---

## 📚 Learning Approach

This repository follows a **theory + packet-level practice** model.

Theory explains *what should happen*.
Wireshark shows *what actually happens*.

## 🧠 Theory Foundation

### 🎥 Primary Theory Resource

**Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking**
📺 YouTube Course (12+ hours)
👉 [https://youtu.be/PhjHXeMNpp8](https://youtu.be/PhjHXeMNpp8)

Used strictly for **networking fundamentals from a security perspective**, including:

* OSI vs TCP/IP (conceptual, not exam-driven)
* IP addressing and ports
* TCP vs UDP behavior
* DNS fundamentals
* How data moves across networks
* End-to-end packet flow across the internet

### ⚠️ Intentionally Skipped

* Cable types
* Enterprise hardware
* Deep subnetting drills
* Vendor-specific configurations

## 🔬 Practical Networking & Packet Analysis

### 📘 Primary Hands-On Resource

**Wireshark Labs — Kurose & Ross**
👉 [https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/wireshark.php](https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/wireshark.php)

These labs form the **core of this repository** and are used to:

* Capture and analyze **real network traffic**
* Understand **packet structure and protocol behavior**
* Analyze:

  * TCP connections and flags
  * UDP behavior
  * DNS queries and responses
  * IP fragmentation and routing behavior
* Follow conversations and traffic flows
* Distinguish **normal vs abnormal traffic**

❌ Memorizing protocol fields
✅ Understanding **why traffic behaves the way it does**

---

## 🧪 Tools Used

* **Wireshark** — Primary and central tool

  * Packet capture
  * Flow analysis
  * Protocol inspection

> No simulators.
> No fake traffic.
> Real packets only.

---

## 📅 Roadmap Overview

### 🟢 Phase 1 — Networking Foundations

* OSI vs TCP/IP (security perspective)
* IP addresses and ports
* TCP vs UDP behavior
* DNS resolution basics
* How packets traverse networks

---

### 🔵 Phase 2 — Packet Analysis with Wireshark

* Capturing real traffic
* Analyzing:

  * TCP handshakes, retransmissions, resets
  * DNS queries, responses, and failures
  * Session establishment and teardown
* Understanding headers and metadata
* Following streams and conversations

> Focus: **Behavior, intent, and anomalies in traffic**

---

## 📂 What This Repository Contains

* 📄 Networking theory notes (security-focused)
* 🧪 Wireshark packet analysis labs
* 📊 Observations on protocol behavior and traffic patterns
* 🧠 Security-driven interpretations of network activity

---

## 🧠 Philosophy Behind This Repo

Most networking resources:

* Are exam-oriented
* Focus on hardware and configuration
* Delay exposure to real traffic

This repository is:

* **Traffic-first**
* **Protocol-focused**
* **Built for cybersecurity learners**
* **Centered on understanding, not memorization**

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters for Cybersecurity

Strong networking fundamentals are critical for:

* Detecting malicious or suspicious traffic
* Understanding attack paths
* Investigating packet captures during incidents
* Building intuition for how attacks move through networks

This repository exists to build that intuition.
